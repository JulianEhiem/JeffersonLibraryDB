## BEST PRACTICES
### An unordered list of things I have learned (the hard way) so far and will try to implement in future projects

- Be thorough about table design
  - Make sure all the entities are listed
  - Make sure all the attributes are listed and well thought of
  - Create Associative tables to achieve normal form
  - Make a list of all the edge cases you can think of
    - Create a db design to mitigate most if not all of them
  - Ensure the relationship between entities are ironclad
- Write queries first for the solution, then optimize
- Read up on more best practices and add them to this list
- Implement any new practices into a working project plan that will be used in future projects
